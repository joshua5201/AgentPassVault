# Agent Rules & Instructions

Agents working on this project must adhere to the specifications and workflows defined in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).

## Core Requirements
- Always verify secret retrieval patterns against the "Missing Secret Flow".
- Ensure all API implementations match the "Human-in-the-Loop" request-response model.
- Maintain security standards for encryption and audit logging as defined in the design document.
- **Documentation Only Mode:** When a prompt starts with "doc:", only modify markdown (`.md`) files. Do not write or modify any source code.
- **Section Preservation:** Never remove existing sections or placeholders in `DESIGN.md` unless explicitly instructed. Always perform a full review of the document after a `replace` operation to ensure no content was lost.
